# enlighteNUS
An integrated mobile quiz application which comprises quizzes on NUS modules as well as general knowledge topics as well as a forum feature to facilitate discussions on quiz questions and related topics.

Project for NUS Orbital\
Level of Achievement: Apollo 11

## Problem Statement
Many quiz applications offer topics which are generic and irrelevant to a personâ€™s course of study. On the other hand, many NUS students often find studying and preparing for examinations tedious and isolating. 
Furthermore, access to past-year papers via NUS libraries is patchy and outdated. 
A quiz application, which doubles as a community for discussion of modules and other extra-curricular topics, will make studying more fun and collaborative, and also improve access to practice questions. 

## Project Solution and Core Features
We aim to create an integrated quiz app that is tailored to help NUS students learn and have fun at the same time. 
The topics we intend to host come from a mix of NUS specific modules and general trivia. The core features will include:
- Authentication and Login (Implemented)
   - Users will need to create an account and login in order to build their profile.
- Create and Play Quizzes (Partially Implemented)
   - Users will be able to contribute new questions and quizzes to a common database for other users to play. Questions can be a short answer format or an MCQ format. Each question has a short explanation for the correct answer and can accept multiple correct answers.
- Edit Previously Contributed Questions and Quizzes
   - Users will be able to modify their questions or quizzes and re-submit them to the database.
- Leaderboard
   - We will include a quiz specific and global leaderboard in our app to encourage healthy competition between users
- Analytics
   - Users will be able to see their own analytics, as well as the analytics of the quizzes they have created. Example data may include, most commonly attempted topic, average score, most incorrectly answered question (of a quiz).
- Reporting Questions
   - Users will be able to flag and report questions which are inappropriate or have incorrect answers/explanations.
- Search
   - Users will be able to search the database for questions based on keywords and topic categories.
- Saving Quizzes, Questions and Answers
   - Users will be able to save quizzes, questions and answers for future reference.
- Forum 
   - A space for users to post questions and discuss answers to quiz questions.
- ChatGPT Integration
   - Users will be able to generate questions from a formatted prompt that is sent to ChatGPT.
